    All these Classes are to do with the defining of the USER

    This code handles the creation of a user area.
    At UTS the $USER is a number and there is no nice name exposed at all.
    However we can query this from the ldap database using ldapsearch.
    Thus we can definr the concept of renderusername and renderusernumber
    this just need to be in the path some place  dabanim/usr/bin
