aerender version 13.5.1x48
USAGE:
   1] aerender renders After Effects comps. The render may be performed either
      by an already running instance of AE or by a newly invoked instance. By
      default, aerender will invoke a new instance of AE, even if one is
      already running. To change this, see the "-reuse" flag below.
   2] aerender takes a series of optional arguments.
      Some are single flags, like "-reuse". Some come in flag-argument
      pairs, like "-project project_path". And one comes in a triplet,
      -mem_usage image_cache_percent max_mem_percent.
   3] aerender with 0 arguments, or with any argument equaling "-help"
      or "-h", prints this usage message.
   4] The arguments are:
      "-h"                    print this usage message
      "-help"                 print this usage message
      "-reuse"                use this flag if you want to try and reuse
                              an already running instance of AE to perform the
                              render.  By default, aerender will launch a new
                              instance of After Effects, even if one is already
                              running.  But, if AE is already running, and the
                              "-reuse" flag is provided, then aerender will
                              ask the already running instance of AE to perform
                              the render. Whenever aerender launches a new
                              instance of AE, it will tell AE to quit when
                              rendering is completed; otherwise, it will not
                              quit AE. Also, the preferences will be written
                              to file upon quit when the "-reuse" flag is
                              specified; otherwise it will not be written.
      "-project project_path" where project_path is a file path or URI
                              specifying a project file to open.
                              If none is provided, aerender will work with the
                              currently open project.
                              If no project is open and no project is provided,
                              an error will result.
      "-comp comp_name"       where comp_name specifies a comp to be rendered.
                              If the comp is in the render queue already, and
                              in a queueable state, then (only) the first
                              queueable instance of that comp on the render
                              queue will be rendered. If the comp is in the
                              project but not in the render queue, then it will
                              be added to the render queue and rendered.
                              If no -comp argument is provided, aerender will
                              render the entire render queue as is. In this
                              case (no -comp), the only other arguments used
                              will be -project, -log, -v, -mem_usage, and
                              -close; the -RStemplate, -OMtemplate, -output,
                              -s, -e,  and -i arguments will be ignored.
      "-rqindex index_in_render_queue"       where index_in_render_queue specifies a
                              render queue item to be rendered. Options that make
                              sense when rendering a single render queue item
                              are available like with the -comp flag.
      "-RStemplate  render_settings_template"  where render_settings_template
                              is the name of a template to apply to the render
                              queue item.If the template does not exist it is
                              an error.
                              Default is to use the render template already
                              defined for the item.
      "-OMtemplate  output_module_template"  where output_module_template
                              is the name of a template to apply to the
                              output module. If the template does not exist
                              it is an error.
                              Default is to use the template already defined
                              for the output module.
      "-output  output_path"  where output_path is a file path or URI
                              specifying the destination render file.
                              Default is the path already in the project file.
      "-log logfile_path"     where logfile_path is a file path or URI
                              specifying the location of the log file.
                              Default is stdout.
      "-s start_frame"        where start_frame is the first frame to render.
                              Default is the start frame in the file.
      "-e end_frame"          where end_frame is the last frame to render.
                              Note, this is "inclusive;" the final frame
                              will be rendered.
                              Default is the end frame in the file.
      "-i increment"          where increment is the number of frames to
                              advance before rendering a new frame. A value
                              of 1 (the default) results in a normal rendering
                              of all frames. Higher increments will repeat the
                              same (frame increment-1) times and then render a
                              new one, starting the cycle again. Higher values
                              result in faster renders but choppier motion.
                              Default is 1.
      "-mem_usage image_cache_percent max_mem_percent"
                              where image_cache_percent specifies the maximum
                              percent of memory used to cache already rendered
                              images/footage, and max_mem_percent specifies
                              the total percent of memory that can be
                              used by After Effects.
      "-v verbose_flag"       where verbose_flag specifies the type of
                              messages reported.  Possible values are ERRORS
                              (prints only fatal and problem errors) or
                              ERRORS_AND_PROGRESS (prints progress of rendering
                              as well).
                              Default value is ERRORS_AND_PROGRESS.
      "-close close_flag"     where close_flag specifies whether or not to
                              close the project when done rendering, and
                              whether or not to save changes. If close_flag is
                              DO_NOT_SAVE_CHANGES, project will be closed
                              without saving changes. If close_flag is
                              SAVE_CHANGES, project will be closed and changes
                              will be saved. If close_flag is DO_NOT_CLOSE the
                              project will be left open; but the project is
                              left open only if using an already-running
                              instance of AE, since new invocations of AE must
                              always close and quit when done.
                              Default value is DO_NOT_SAVE_CHANGES.
      "-sound sound_flag"     where sound_flag specifies whether or not to play
                              a sound when rendering is complete. Possible
                              values are "ON" or "OFF".
                              Default value is "OFF".
      "-version"              displays the version number of aerender to the
                              console. Does not render.
      "-continueOnMissingFootage"
                              Do not stop rendering on missing footage. Log and
                              render with placeholder color bars.
   5] EXAMPLES:
      To render just Comp 1 to a specified file:
          aerender -project /Volumes/Stuff/projects/proj1.aep -comp "Comp 1"
                   -output /Volumes/Stuff/output/proj1/proj1.mov
      To render everything in the render queue as is in the project file:
          aerender -project /Volumes/Stuff/projects/proj1.aep
      To render frames 1-10 using multi-machine render:
          aerender -project /Volumes/Stuff/projects//proj1.aep
                   -comp "Comp 1" -RStemplate "Multi-Machine Settings"
                   -OMtemplate "Multi-Machine Sequence" -s 1 -e 10
                   -output /Volumes/Stuff/output/proj1/frames\[####\].psd
